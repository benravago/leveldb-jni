leveldb (https://code.google.com/p/leveldb/) for Android

Very simple bindings for using Leveldb from android.
There's an excellent project leveldbjni out there for using leveldb from Java, but it seems a bit too much. It has a bunch of dependencies, including a code generator, which might or might not work on Android. At least it is not trivial to get started.
